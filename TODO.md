# Things still to do in repository web-tests-grunt

## JavaScript

Add-on jquery.edittreetable is not installable via npm and hasn't been updated since 2014. Need to think about how to add to repository as a "static" resource...

Library moment.js is distributed as ES6, i.e. will need transpiling to ES5.
